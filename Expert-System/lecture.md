# Expert System:
* An Expert System in AI is a computer program that emulates the decision making ability of a human expert in a specific domain or field. 
* It is designed to provide intelligent solutions to a problem the knowledge and reasoning processes of human experts. 
* Expert systems typically consist of a knowledge base, an inference engine, and a user interface.

> The expert system is a part of AI, and the first ES was developed in the year 1970, which was the first successful approach of artificial intelligence. It solves the most complex issue as an expert by extracting the knowledge stored in its knowledge base. The system helps in decision making for complex problems using both facts and heuristics like a human expert. It is called so because it contains the expert knowledge of a specific domain and can solve any complex problem of that particular domain. These systems are designed for a specific domain, such as medicine, science, computer etc.

### Component of Expert System
 * Knowledge Base: This component stores knowledge from human experts in the domain. It contains rules, facts and other necessary information for problem-solving.
 * Rules Engine: The rules engine is responsible for interpreting and applying the knowledge stored in the knowledge base to solve problems. It uses reasoning mechanisms, such as rule-based reasoning, fuzzy logic.
 * User Interface: The user interface provides a way for users to interact with the expert system, inputting queries or problems and receiving responses or solutions. It may take various forms, such as a command-line interface, graphical user interface(GUI), or natural language interface.

## Characteristics of Expert System
 * High Performance: The expert system provides highperformance for solving any type of complex problem of aspecific domain with high efficiency and accuracy.
 * Understandable: It responds in a way that can be easily understandable by the user. It can take input in humanlanguage and provides the output in the same way.
 * Reliable: It is much reliable for generating an efficient andaccurate output.
 * Highly responsive: ES provides the result for any complex query within a very short period of time.

## Participants in the development of Expert System
 There are three primary participants in the building of Expert System:
 1. Expert: The success of an ES much depends on the knowledge provided by human experts. These experts are those persons who are specialized in that specific domain.
 2. Knowledge Engineer: Knowledge engineer is the person who gathers the knowledge from the domain experts and then codifies that knowledge to the system according to the formalism.
 3. End-User: This is a particular person or a group of people who may not be experts, and working on the expert system needs the solution or advice for his queries, which are complex.

 ## Advantages of Expert System
 * These systems are highly reproducible.
 * They can be used for risky places where the human presence is not safe.
 * Error possibilities are less if the KB contains correct knowledge.
 * The performance of these systems remains steady as it is not affected by emotions, tension, or fatigue.
 * They provide a very high speed to respond to a particular query.

 ## Limitations of Expert System
 * The response of the expert system may get wrong if the knowledge base contains the wrong information.
 * Like a human being, it cannot produce a creative output for different scenarios.
 * Its maintenance and development costs are very high.
 * Knowledgeacquisition for designing is much difficult.
 * For each domain, we require a specific ES, which is one of the big limitations.
 * It cannot learn from itself and hence requires manual updates.

## Applications of Expert System
 * In designing and manufacturing domain. It can be used for designing and manufacturing physical devices such as camera lenses and automobiles.
 * In the knowledge domain. These systems are primarily used for publishing the relevant knowledge to the users. The two popular ES used for this domain is an advisor and a tax advisor.
 * In the finance domain. In the finance industries, it is used to detect any type of possible fraud, suspicious activity, and advise bankers that if they should provide loans for business or not.
 * In the diagnosis and troubleshooting of devices. In medical diagnosis, the ES system is used, and it was the first area where these systems were used.
 * Planning and Scheduling. The expert systems can also be used for planning and scheduling some particular tasks for achieving the goal of that task.
